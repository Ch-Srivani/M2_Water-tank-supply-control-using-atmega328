My goal is to make an automatic water supply of water to tank.
Requirements:
atmega328
ultrasonic sensor(input)
servo motor(output)
LED'S (Indication)
This is constructed and executed in Simulide software.As of the virtual input to the ultrasonic sensor I used a voltmeter in which connected to ULTRsonic sensor to create a input to the microprocessor.
